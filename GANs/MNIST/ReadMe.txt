Hi

Nothing here. Download the MNIST dataset using torchvision. 

Why no template given for GANS?
Because we know you don't need it. Refer to recitation videos when in doubt.

Also, what you get after implementing 5_2_1 is pretty much the template for training. Also don't need to write your own data loader, use torchvision directly as you're dealing with MNIST data.

TIP: Try different GAN architectures and see the difference. Must try out MLP, CNN based architecture.


Enjoy!
